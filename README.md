Detect if a contract has been deployed in the latest (or predefined) block from an address that was previously funded through Tornado.Cash.

## Installation

It is recommended to install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) through the `npm` package manager, which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) when you install it on your system. It is recommended to use a Node.js version `>= 18.0.0`.

Once you have `npm` installed, you can run the following both to install and upgrade `pnpm`:

```console
npm install -g pnpm
```

After having installed `pnpm`, simply run:

```console
pnpm install
```
